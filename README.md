# semVersie

`[vɛrzi]` Is the dutch word for version,

This project calculates semantic-version bumps (major/minor/patch) from
conventional-commit style pull requests and can be used in a GitHub Actions
workflow to automatically determine the next release version.

We explicitly try to keep things simple by having the user deal with the
intricacies of the actual release process, this keeps the action relatively lean
and understandable without limiting the useability to a few languages.

## Usage (GitHub Actions)

Example workflow snippet that runs the action and exposes the computed version
as a job output:

```yaml
jobs:
  version:
    name: semVersie
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    outputs:
      version: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
    steps:
      - name: Calculate version
        id: semVersie
        uses: RonaldPhilipsen/semVersie@vX.Y.Z
        with:
          # Optional: pass build metadata (e.g. commit SHA)
          build-metadata: ${{ github.sha }}
```

Please note that running this action from a non-fixed version is _not_ supported

## Development

The project uses Node.js for tests/build. Useful scripts (from `package.json`):

- npm run build — build the distribution (ncc)
- npm test — run tests
- npm run lint — run ESLint

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open issues or pull requests on the GitHub
repository. Follow the conventional commits format for PR titles so the tool can
infer versions correctly.
